  <h1>Just-in-time warlording</h1>

  <ul>
    <li class="odd">[Most names changed.]</li>

    <li class="even"><span class="label user_1">&lt;Ram&gt;</span>
    i just saw an ad for travian</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class="label user_1">&lt;Ram&gt;</span>
    watttt</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_2">&lt;mochi&gt;</span> there are tons of ads for
    travian</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class="label user_1">&lt;Ram&gt;</span> i
    have adblock on most of the time i guess</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_3">&lt;krazykat&gt;</span> there are two AT&amp;T
    guys outside arguing about putting in my new circuit. a grumpy
    younger one and a grinny older one</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> wow there are a lot of
    travian bots. did these exist when we played?</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_3">&lt;krazykat&gt;</span> I had never heard of
    this game. Is it enjoyable?</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> well, we turned it into
    a programming exercise instead of a game. i'm not sure what
    that says.</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_5">&lt;bongo&gt;</span> it was fun when i played it
    and scripted it (mostly by thieving from lemonodor). and at the
    end i got into some absolutely massive hierarchal
    alliance/raiding group. then it was done (there's an endgame so
    particular instances of the game end). and that was enough</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class="label user_5">&lt;bongo&gt;</span>
    crushing little people at the end was probably the best
    part</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_3">&lt;krazykat&gt;</span> crunchy *and* chewy</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> i got bored</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> my script looked for
    settlements owned by people who had i. not logged in for a
    while and ii. were not part of an alliance, so didn't have
    friends to avenge them. i think this was joshua's idea</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> and it farmed them
    mercilessly and efficiently</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> kept track of thousands
    of raiding parties active 24 hours a day</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> basically antstyle</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> once a week or so i'd
    get a message from someone asking why i was attacking them and
    i'd just put them on an exception list</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> every so often i'd log
    in and create more troops for more raiding parties</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> every target settlement
    within a few hundred hexes that fit my criteria was being hit
    about every 5-10 minutes by a raiding aparty</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> the travel time between
    my hq and the targets sometimes was over a day, i think</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> it was sorta
    just-in-time warlording. i never had any troops in my
    settlements, they were always en route to a target or on the
    return trip.</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> once in a while i'd
    screw up and someone would join an alliance and then attack me,
    if i thought i would need to fight i'd just stop the script and
    let my troops levels accumulate as they returned from
    attacks</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> i always wondered how
    many other people were doing the same thing, if the same
    villages i was attacking were also being attacked by 10 other
    people just as frequently.</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class="label user_6">&lt;dong&gt;</span>
    Beautiful.</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> then i got more bored
    and just threw everything i had at one of the biggest members
    of a big alliance.</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> i destroyed something
    like 95% of his army, but i was completely spent and a few
    hours later they basically destroyed me.</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> heh. some of the people
    who asked me not to attack were far off, so i'd tell them ok
    i'll stop but there are already 30 more parties on the way that
    i can't recall, sorry, here are some resources.</li>

    <li class="odd"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> have this timber, on
    me</li>

    <li class="even"><span class=
    "label user_4">&lt;lemonodor&gt;</span> since the Fail-Safe
    option wasn't available.</li>
